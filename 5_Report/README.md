## IDENTIFYING FEATURES

Audio is an important source of communication and is as important as text in today’s time. We know that the audio files are digital files. Therefore, there is a need of a tool to run the digital files or in other words, play the files. Without this tool or player, we’ll never be able to listen to music, movies or the contents of any audio file.
Thus, we need MP3 players. It is a device using to play MP3s and other digital audio files. We can build this by ourselves without have to download and install premium music players. The Mp3 player GUI project idea attempts to emulate the physical MP3 Player.
This program will allow you to play songs, music, and all MP3 files on your desktop or laptops. MP3 player using Python is a basic programming application built using the programming language Python. It is a GUI program built by the means of Python libraries Tkinter, Pygame and Mutagen.
The MP3 player application should have the capabilities of playing a song, create and display a playlist, pause and resume a long and change the song, that is, play the previous or next song.
